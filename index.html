                            <p>For the 80% of the global workforce that does not work behind a desk, technology is increasingly being valued for boosting productivity and improving job satisfaction. Yet, the availability of appropriately-suited technologies continue to under-serve this forgotten workforce.</p>

                            <p>Approximately 80% of the global workforce is considered “deskless.” At Emergence, we use the term “Deskless Workforce” in reference to the 2.7 billion employees around the world that are not desk-bound for the majority of their role.</p>
                            <p>This workforce makes up a large percentage of many of the important and essential industries that keep our economy running, from healthcare, agriculture, construction and retail to manufacturing, telecommunications and transportation. Despite the proliferation of mobile devices and incredible innovation of applications across Silicon Valley, for many decades these traditionally “deskless” industries have continued to be underserved by clunky legacy software that was not purpose-built for the unique needs of these workers.</p>
                            <p>Our firm sees this as a massive opportunity and we have been focused on supporting the entrepreneurs who are building companies and creating transformative solutions to address the Deskless Workforce’s unique needs.</p>
                            <p>In a 2018 survey of IT decision makers across these top industries, we reported that 82% of respondents planned to increase spending on deskless technology. This year, we wanted to gain a better understanding of the end users—the deskless workers themselves—to learn more about how the technology has been received and better understand their perspective; what types of technologies are being provided by employers, impact on their job and the importance of technology when considering a new role.</p>
                            <p>While planning to deploy the survey in early 2020, COVID-19 became a global pandemic. Many of the deskless industries were severely impacted, and in order to continue to operate, employers had to adhere to strict ordinances set by local and national governments. While traditional desk-bound industries made relatively quick transitions setting employees up to work from home, we revised a portion of our survey to better understand the role technology has played across the Deskless Workforce.</p>
